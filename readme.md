# Have you No_Class ?
No_Doubt. From Bootstrap to Tailwind, and countless others in between, stylesheets devised by large groups and corporations insist you accept their blueprints as gospel in order to accomplish and accommodate your goals.

Without exercising any measure of critical thinking, it is natural to accept this messaging. However, as anyone who has invested time and energy into using exceedingly large and opinionated stylesheets can attest, these solutions regularly create more problems than they claim to solve.
While there are benefits to using highly manufactured and processed frameworks (now you can split-up the work of a single person among dozens of people who should all be able to contribute and not mess up anything!), these behemoths consistently prove to be overkill for the majority of projects. If you or your organization chooses to adopt one of these frameworks, you are locked-in. That choice is a commitment tantamount to a contract or marriage. Transitioning away from one processed framework to another will demand time, specialized effort from trained professionals, and most of your operational expenditure for the remaining calendar year.

In theory, in a vacuum, if you ignore reality, then please go enjoy. This is not for you. This is for people who have No_Class. This is for people who have No Time to waste. For those who have No Care for bullsh** they do not need. For those who have No Respect for frameworks that reinvent so much of what is already available out of the box with traditional markup elements, CSS Flexbox, and CSS Grid. This is for those who want to deliver the best work, the most efficient work, with nothing that is not needed.

Bloated CSS frameworks can intimidate and frustrate even the most practiced designers and developers. That is why Wix and SquareSpace exist. For those who are scared and lazy. The idea that you must learn and abide by all of the rules set forth in a framework devised out of congested groupthink is backwards. It creates a natural barrier to entry that hinders interest and adoption.

No_Class is a blank slate. No_Class encourages minimalism, efficiency, and creative thinking. No_Class is for the best of us. Make what you make with No_Class.

## Why make this ?
No_Brainer. Semantic HTML markup provides dozens of usable targets to start and maintain your projects. This blank slate perspective enables more creativity and opportunities for expression. No_Class uses this foundation to provide the best, leanest, and most efficient stylesheet that can help kickstart any web based idea. It is designed to look great on all screen sizes and devices, and it is set up for rapid prototyping and scalability.

## Is this right for my project ?
No_Idea. But if you value modern, clean code and semantic markup structure, then chances are you may think Yes! With a set of CSS variables predefined and all usable HTML markup tags accounted for, No_Class is built to configure and scale. Rather than getting overwhelmed by CSS, enjoy being surprised and delighted by CSS. Instead of hunting and researching how best to reference a tome of hundreds of custom classes, start with a clean slate. You do not have to believe this, but you do not really need a hundred different `div`s. At one time, for some scenarios, that was reasonable, but with the constantly growing list of new markup tags available it is almost criminal to not utilize what is freely available.

## There are other frameworks like this
No_Kidding. And some of them are great. No_Offense if you choose one of those. Honestly, doing so is the whole point in the grand scheme of things. Chipping away at the blind follower count of Bootstrap is God's work. Definitely check out water.css, mvp.css, new.css, and the others.

No_Class is released under the permissive MIT license so you can freely use it however you like. Personal projects, commercial ventures, and errant forks that have No_Class are all cool. Happy coding.
